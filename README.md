# Promotion Plan of Research Data Management at CUHK
1.	Choose proper database for different type of research data.
There are mainly 2 types of data: table data and file data. Choose different database to fit different types of data but apply the same project index system.

2.	Build adapter for different database.
Make data join easier between different database with same or similar features. For example, clinical notes and medical images for patients with same ID.

3.	Non-technical and technical research data access method.

4.	Security and encryption.
